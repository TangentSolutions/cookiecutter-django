# Buidling

1. Running type checks with mypy:

```bash
$ mypy {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
```

2. Tests and coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

```bash
$ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django pytest
$ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django py.test --cov=. --cov-report=html
$ open htmlcov/index.html
```

{% if cookiecutter.use_celery == "y" %}

# Celery

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

```bash
cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
celery -A taskapp worker -l info
```

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.
